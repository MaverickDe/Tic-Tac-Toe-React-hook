Prerequisites

``` bash
This summarizes the use of basic react hooks (useEffect,useRef and useState) in building simple game algorithms

```


React Hook
```bash
Hooks were first introduced in React 16.8. And they're great because they let you use more of React's features â€“ like managing your component's state, or performing an after effect when certain changes occur in state(s) without writing a class.


The state of your application is bound to change at some point. This could be the value of a variable, an object, or whatever type of data exists in your component.

To make it possible to have the changes reflected in the DOM, we have to use a React hook called useState. 



```


Conclusion


```bash
If you have gone through the code on this repo, then you should have a good understanding of what hooks are in React, how to use them, and how to create your own custom Hooks. And the best way to fully understand this is to practice so don't just read through.

This code covers the core areas of hooks, but it won't teach you all there is to know about hooks. So make sure you check out the React JS documentation so you can learn more about them.
